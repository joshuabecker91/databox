SETUP YOUR INITIAL REPOSITORY - Steps
1. Create an empty folder with exactly the same name as repo 'codetube'
2. cd into that folder
3. git init 
4. git remote add origin (pasteRepositoryWebUrlHere)
5. git remote -v
6. git branch -M main
7. git pull origin main  
   Grabs all the updated files from the main repo
8. When you want to start coding a new feature start new branch first
9. you can now start coding in your new branch. git status to see what has been changed in your branch at any time.
10. when you want to upload your branch.  git add .  stage your files
11. git commit -m "uploading updates"  commit your files with comment  
12. git push origin (nameofbranchyouhavebeencodingin)     to upload your committed files


STARTING TO CODE A NEW FEATURE
git pull origin main - do this constantly so you avoid merge conflicts at all cost. 
Always do this before starting new code, make sure your copy of the repo is up to date! Before you start coding -
1. Make sure you are in the main branch (check with):  git branch 
2. git checkout main   (if not in main branch and to switch to main)
3. git pull origin main 
4. Now your main branch is up to date with main so you can now -
   Create a new branch that you will be coding in
   git checkout -b nameofyourbranch


WHAT BRANCH AM I WORKING IN?
You can check what branch you are in at any time
git branch
also it shows on bottom left of vs code


OTHER NOTES
Always push your new code branch up to the remote. Do not do any local merges. 
Then others can review that code and decide if they want to merge them with the master/main branch on the remote repository.

git reset         :will unstage all staged files 

Sync fork button will update your main branch with the main branch of the admin of repo.

Once you push your branch, on github you can open a new pull request. This sends request to admin where they can click to merge.
